            In everything you do, you get better by doing and iterating as you go.
            Focus as much of your thinking and brain power into your product building efforts and learning how your product performs and succeeds.
            Set up clear frameworks and processes so you don't need to re-invent the wheel whenever you need to evaluate your
            product's purpose, assess your strategical focus areas or think what to build next. And do all of these activties on a regular basis.
