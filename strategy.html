        <h2 id="ways">Key Questions for Building Your Product Strategy</h2>
        <div>
        Strategy takes your product's purpose to practice. Your product strategy should answer at least the following
        questions: Why should your customers care about your product? Who are those customers? How does your product
        fill the gaps in the market? How will you measure success? What do you need to build and do you have the 
        expertise and resources you need in order to build that? How do you validate what you are building is
        taking you towards the desired outcomes and towards success?

        <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
        <div>
            Start from the outcomes and keep the focus purely on the value you want to provide. 
            Align your your users' success to your product's success. When your product enters
            the market, competitors are likely to react and hence the market is constantly evolving.
            Make sure you have the expertise and resources to constantly deliver value unattainable
            with the competitors' products.
