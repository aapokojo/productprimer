YouTube was built for video\n          content creators with the mindset that you first record the content, then publish it, and then engage with it. And\n          how YouTube was built and operated, and how the content was monetised, was based on this core idea. \n          Twitch on the other hand focused on the real-timeness of the video streaming and audience engagement experience, including the live chat. \n          All of this was enabled by new technologies that made real-time livestreaming possible. Twitch also introduced new subscription \n          models and donation systems that enabled the content creators to monetise their audience \n          in a completely new way compared to the incumbent platforms at the time. Essentially Twitch built a platform tailored to \n          live gameplay, where the audience could interact in real time. This focus allowed them to bypass the crowded \n          and competitive mainstream streaming market. While YouTube continues to be the largest video streaming platform, \n          Twitch has created a sizable business from capturing the audience in the live streaming market, \n          making it the billion dollar business it is today.\n        </div>\n      </section>\n\n      <section id=\"keytakeawayspurpose\">\n        <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n        <div className=\"content-text\">\n            Your product does not operate in a vacuum.
