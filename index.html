        <h4>A Starter Guide to Building Great* Products (*great is not always successful)</h4>
        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <div>
        Welcome to Product Primer – <i>A Starter Guide to Building Great Products* (*great is not always successful)</i>. 
        The primer presents a collection of theoretical frameworks and practical methods for product development, 
        integrating diverse perspectives from technology, creativity, and business strategy. It challenges the conventional notion 
        that a great product is automatically a successful one. Instead, it focuses on what's in your control - empowering 
        you build great products that serve a purpose and solve real problems.
        </div>
        <div>
        The perspectives and advice offered in this primer are highly opinionated, 
        drawn directly from the author's extensive experience in product building. 
        Whether you're a seasoned professional or just starting out, this guide is designed to provoke thought, 
        inspire innovation, and ultimately assist you in crafting products that aim to make a difference.

        <h2>About the Author</h2>
        <div>
        Aapo Kojo has nearly two decades of experience in building digital products. 
        Some of the products he has put his work into have achieved success through strong business outcomes, 
        positive user sentiment, or prestigious awards. He has also witnessed the rapid downfall of a business giant 
        and the demise of a nearly successful startup. Throughout these varied experiences, 
        one common thread remains: the commitment to building a great product.
        </div>  
    </section>

    <section id="purpose">
        <h1>What is the purpose of the product?</h1>
        <h4>Finding the key value proposition</h4>
        <h2 id="users">Enough users for a sizable audience?</h2>
        <div>
        Ultimately, every single product can be reduced to a specific user need, and hence to an individual user.
        To make a great product, you need to find out if there is a critical amount of users that have a specific need, 
        which can be better met with your product, and isn’t served well enough with anything else out there. 
        Chances here though are against you - there is already very likely a product or a solution the user is equipped 
        with to tackle their problems and to fulfill their needs.Your job is to figure out a way to provide the users 
        with something they didn’t know they needed. If they don’t know, how would you then? You might have some ideas, 
        but how would you know if an idea is worth pursuing for, and worth making into a product?
        </div>
        <div>            
        The space where you are working in, could be anything from enhancing the mobile experience for brick and mortar stores 
        selling to online marketplaces, building a platform for short form content creators or building tools 
        to organize the work for reachtstack drivers in a container ship terminal. Whatever the context is, 
        your intended product will be competing with existing ways of working, established habits 
        and products already available at the market - be it your own or your competitors.
        </div>
        <img src="users.jpg">
        <div>
        Is there a large enough audience for my product, which is currently underserved in the market?
        Can my product offer them something that isn’t offered by anything else out there?
        </div>
    </section>

    <section id="uniquvalueprop">
        <h2>Finding the Unique Value Proposition</h2>
        <div>
        Frameworks, like the Blue Ocean / Red Ocean strategy framework, or the work of Clayton Christensen on Innovators Solution, 
        help you frame your product idea and solution against that existing world, where your users are interacting with existing solutions. 
        What are the elements of my product that are directly competing against the existing market?  
        What are the users' existing expectations from a product in the market? What are the elements of my product 
        that provide value other products currently can’t?
        </div>
        <div>            
        Focusing on the current users, their current needs and how the existing product solves those problems, 
        you end up iterating on the existing products or offerings - and end up competing with similar, 
        but better features or with a cheaper solution, but fail to look beyond what are the unmet 
        needs and potential to create new innovations.
        </div>
        <img src="blueocean.jpg">
        <div>
        Blue Ocean strategy framework helps you identify where the current industry competition and investments are the highest - 
        where you should do the minimal investments to offer a minimal level of service, and instead put most of 
        your investments into the areas of your product where you create value beyond what is currently available in the market.
        </div>
        <div>
        Example of a blue ocean strategy from the video streaming space: Founders of Twitch recognized that gamers had unique 
        needs not met by the then existing incumbent video streaming services, such as YouTube. Twitch focused on 
        the real-timeness of the video streaming experience, including the live chat. Twitch introduced 
        new subscription models and donation systems that enabled the content creators to monetise their audience 
        in a completely new way compared to the incumbent platforms at the time. Essentially Twitch built a platform tailored to 
        live gameplay, where the audience could interact in real time. This focus allowed them to bypass the crowded 
        and competitive mainstream streaming market. While YouTube continues to be the largest video streaming platform, 
        Twitch has created a sizable business from capturing the audience in the live streaming market, 
        making it the billion dollar business it is today.

        <div>
            Your product does not operate in a vacuum. Users have needs - which are already solved by one way or the other. 
            Find out what is the minimum you need to invest to match the existing solutions and 
            put most of your bets in the competing factors other solutions don’t offer.
