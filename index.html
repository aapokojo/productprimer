        integrating diverse perspectives from technology, creativity, and business strategy. It challenges the conventional notion 
        that a great product is automatically a successful one. Instead, it focuses on what's in your control - empowering 
        you build great products that serve a purpose and solve real problems.

        <h2>About the Author</h2>
        <div>
        Aapo Kojo has nearly two decades of experience in building digital products. 
        Some of the products he has put his work into have achieved success through strong business outcomes, 
        positive user sentiment, or prestigious awards. He has also witnessed the rapid downfall of a business giant 
        and the demise of a nearly successful startup. Throughout these varied experiences, 
        one common thread remains: the commitment to building a great product.
